# Custom Servers
I recommend to play this mod only on custom servers (for example [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor), note that modded handshake is required to play the mod [Example Modded Handshake by js6pak](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor.Impostor)), if you own an Impostor server, make sure AntiCheat and BanIpFromGame are set to false in the config.json file. This mod adds two custom server regions to play with, Modded NA (MNA) and Modded EU (MEU), and also has [Unify by Daemon](https://github.com/MoltenMods/Unify) implemented, which you can use to select the custom region to join a custom server by entering the IP or domain name and the port of the server.

-----------------------

# Settings
This mod adds a custom lobby which I won't spoil to you, it also adds four colors (Lavender, Petrol, Mint and Olive) and five settings to the client option tab:
- **Hide Room Code:** More like streamer mode, activating this option will hide the room code and replace it with "Las Monjas"
- **Game Summary:** Activating this option will create a list containing which role and task progress the players had after the game ends.
- **Activate Music:** Music pack containing 7 songs from Kevin MacLeod (1 for Lobby, 3 for Tasks and 3 for Meeting depending of how many players are alive)
- **Ghost Can See Roles:** Only after being reported, ghosts will be able to see which role the players have.
- **Horse Mode:** Activate 2022 1st April Fools, remember to take of your skin if you activate Horse Mode.

-----------------------

# Roles

Roles can be activated by putting them at 100% spawn rate (there's only 0% and 100%). Activated roles will be assigned randomly to the players. There's a total of four teams and it can be only be 1 Neutral and 1 Rebel per game.

- Thief team only win if they manage to steal all the Jewels.
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.
- Capturing a Thief teleports him to the Prison, another Thief have to push the button outside the prison to release it.
- Releasing a Thief only release the one who's been more time in Prison, that Thief gets teleported to the Thief spawm base.
- Thief team can use vents (can't use while they're reviving).
- You can't kill (or arrest if you're Police) your teammates.
- After taking a Jewel, the Thief can't put it back, he has to deliver it and can only take 1 Jewel per time.
- While taking a Jewel, the Thief can't kill or use vents.
- Killing or capturing a Thief who has a Jewel makes the Jewel teleports back to its original position.
- If Police team can't see jewels, they will see only if a Thief is delivering one
- Police team has a button to increase their light vision for 10 seconds
- There are custom messages for match duration, delivered jewel, captured Thief and released Thief, also the game score is always displayed.
- If a Thief who has a Jewel disconnects from the match, the Jewel stays where that player was.
- Also if a Thief disconnects, the required captured Thief updates too.
- Revive Time value is calculated by subtracting Invincibility Time value from it, for example if Revive Time is 8 and Invincibility Time is 3, players will revive after 5 seconds but will be invincible for another 3 seconds after reviving.

## KingOfTheHill

Match between green and yellow team. There's a total of 3 capturable zones in the map and each team has a King who can capture them. Among us support 15 players, which is an odd number. On odd player number games a special role called Usurper will appear.

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**

- Kings are marked with a team color's aura around them.
- Everyone can vent but the Kings can't.
- Capturable zones are marked with an arrow colored with the team color who captured it (or white if nobody has it yet)
- Each captured zone gives 1 point per second to the team who captured it.
- You can't kill your own teammates.
- If a King gets killed, his team will lose every captured zone, turning them into white color.
- A captured zone can be stolen by the other King.
- If a King disconnects from the game, another King will be assigned randomly between team players.
- The Usurper always loses, he can kill everyone and if he kills a King he becomes one, making the old King the new Usurper
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.

## HotPotato

A random player gets the Hot Potato role, that player has to give the hot potato to another player before the time runs out, otherwise the hot potato player will die. It can be only 1 Hot Potato on the game, the rest will be Cold Potato or Burnt Potato if they died. This gamemode also works as Hide and Seek gamemode because Cold Potato will try to hide from the Hot Potato, I highly recommend to play it on MiraHQ.

| Option  | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Match Duration | From 5 to 7 and half minutes |
| Hot Potato Time Limit | Time before the Hot Potato explodes |
| Hot Potato Cooldown | Give Hot Potato Cooldown |
| Cold Potatoes Vision | Light range for Cold Potato players |
| Reset Hot Potato timer after Transfer | Hot Potato Time Limit doesn't reset |
| Extra Time when timer doesn't reset | Hot Potato Extra Time Limit if it doesn't reset |

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- First round doesn't have a time limit, this way when the Hot Potato transfers for the first time, every player get the timer synchronized.
- Each player name color will be the same as the team color.
- Only Hot Potato player can use vents.
- Nobody can kill on this gamemode.
- Hot Potato player will have a potato above his player.
- When the Hot Potato explodes or disconnects from the game, another random alive player will get the Hot Potato role.
- Giving the Hot Potato to another player makes that player unable to move for the next 3 seconds, also Hot Potato Time Limit resets.
- There are custom messages for match duration, who is the Hot Potato, how many Cold Potatoes are alive and time for giving the Hot Potato.

-----------------------

## Zombie Laboratory

A random player gets the Zombie role, another player the Nurse role and the rest will be Survivors. The zombie must infect everyone to win, while the survivors have to look for the key items hided in boxes around the map to give them to the Nurse so she can make the cure and win the game. This gamemode adds a new zone on the map, the Infirmary. If timer reach 0, zombie team will win.

| Option  | Description |

| Kill Cooldown | Kill Button cooldown |
| Revive Time | Everyone revives on his team base after a setted amount of time |
| Invincibility Time After Revive | Players can't use their abilities, vent or get killed during this time |

**Additional Gamemode Notes:**
- Only Zombies can use vents.
- Zombies can infect other player by standing near to him the needed time. Infected players name will turn from blue to yellow but they remain as Survivor during the time limit to use medkit.
- If the time to use medkit reach 0 (this timer doesn't show anywhere to add tension), that Survivor will turn into a Zombie.
-Nurse is immune to the infection, she can pick a medkit (pointed by pink arrows) from 3 different map location and use it on a infected player (yellow name) to cure it. She can carry only 1 medkit at once and will lose it if she gets killed. A healed player has to be infected again to try to turn it into a zombie.
- Infirmary is the Nurse's spawn and only survivors can enter in it. After 10 seconds, survivors will be forced to exit it. The Nurse can enter and stay in it anytime she wants, also she can leave from 3 different location to prevent Zombie spawn camping. There's 2 switches in the Infirmary, the left one is for delivering a key item and the right one is to create the cure when all key items are delivered, making the Survivor team the winner.
- Survivors have to look for the key items hided in the boxes around the map and deliver them to the Infirmary.
- Zombies can kill, the Nurse can't and the Survivors can find ammo on random boxes, which makes them able to kill 1 time (after being killed or killing a Zombie they will have to search the same ammo box to recharge their kill button)
- Boxes loot are random for every player even the location is the same for everyone. There are 60 box on every map, 6 of them contains the key items, 4 contains ammo and the rest are empty. For example Survivor 1 can find ammo on Admin while Survivor 2 finds it on Reactor, the same goes with the key items. 
- If you're delivering a key item, you can't search boxes or kill and you'll lose it if you die or turn into a zombie, making the key item return to their original location.
- If a Zombie disconnects from the game and was the only one, survivors will win. Also if the Nurse disconnects, zombie team will win.
- There are custom messages for somebody gets infected, delivered a key item or someone turned into a zombie.
- Revive Time value is calculated by subtracting Invincibility Time value from it, for example if Revive Time is 8 and Invincibility Time is 3, players will revive after 5 seconds but will be invincible for another 3 seconds after reviving.
- Score message is always shown, telling how many key items had been delivered, how many survivors are alive, how many infected are and how many zombies are.

# CustomCosmetics

A custom hats system (adapted from [xxomega77](https://github.com/xxomega77xx/HatPack)) has been added, also thanks to that I could add a method to add custom visors and nameplates too. Hats don't replace visors and some have adaptative color. It can also have some color or position bugs, we'll try to fix them in the future while also adding new hats.

-----------------------

# Submerged

From Las Monjas 1.5.0 version, [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged) is included on the modpack and can be played either on roles game or any gamemodes. When a Submerged update is available, a cyan button will appear on the bottom-left on the main menu to update Submerged. There's still a few changes when playing on Submerged exclusively:
- Custom arrows points towards the closest Elevator if the target is on the other floor.
- Central vents (the ones on the glass floor) can be used only by impostor roles. Any crewmate who can vent won't be able to use them.
- Mimic has a visual bug, if you're transformed into other player and get out of a vent, the hat (if it's adaptative) goes back to its original color, but its only a visual bug for the Mimic player, meaning other players still see the correct hat color.
- Challenger's arena has a visual bug, players won't see the others on the other floor.
- Mechanic can't fix O2 sabotage since it affects the players individually.
- Time traveler's rewind makes the players go back to the central area on both floors instead going back in time.
- Welder can't seal central vents or the one-way vent + its exit.
- Spiritualist and Necromancer revive point is fixed to Medbey on the upper floor and security on the lower one, instead the body's location.
- Vigilant can't put extra cameras, only check them remotely.
- Puppeteer has a visual bug, if you're transformed into other player and get out of a vent, the hat (if it's adaptative) goes back to its original color, but its only a visual bug for the Puppeteer player, meaning other players still see the correct hat color.
- Archer only gets aim assist for the players on the same floor as him.
- Ninja can't use Ninja Time if his target is on the other floor.
- Puppeteer initial transform position gets replaced by Medbey on the upper floor and security on the lower one.
- All gamemodes use both floors, there's two revive points based on the player's floor and central vents can't be used.
